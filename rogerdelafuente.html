    Welcome to my CV! I love the fact that you're looking at the source - please mention it!
    I wrote this years ago with just Skeleton as a basic CSS library.
    A lot of things have happened in the frontend world since then!
    Keeping my CV on the latest technology isn't my priority tho, so
    if you came here to maybe assess my coding skills... let's do that in a live interview :)

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>I'm a <span class="currentAge">36</span> years old computer programmer, recently moved
            back to Europe after ~7 years in Sydney, Australia.
            For the last 7+ years I've worked at Atlassian, anything from Billing, Growth, to products like
            Jira & Confluence, as a senior full stack engineer.
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <h4>Skills</h4>
        <p>
            I'm a fast learner, passionate about my job and interested mostly in having big impact
            in the areas I work in.
            In the last few years I've worked in full stack app development (SpringBoot, React,
            GraphQL, ORMs... + AWS stack - DynamoDB, Lambdas, RDS, EC2, ECS, EKS...)
            with a focus in scalability and high availability.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to understand the products I work on and develop ownership in certain areas so I
            can help maximize the impact my work can have.
            I'm also a good team player; I think a very important part of my job is to mentor and empower new
            generations of developers.
        </p>

                    in the Sydney (and now Amsterdam) offices. I landed in Billing Systems, with my whole team being
                    moved to Growth shortly after. After half a year hacking Atlassian's funnel to
                    reduce friction
                    in the signup process for our customers I moved to Jira's new UI team, where we
                    built a React
                    application from scratch for the company's flagship product. After that I worked
                    in JSM Cloud as part of the Assets team: an acquired product we brought into our platform, which meant understanding their codebase and infrastructure (Kotlin + Kubernetes + Postgres + React) and bringing new internal teams up to speed with it.

                    etc. to source code diving
                    and product hacking. Also solution architectural design and product
                    installation, configuration,
                    etc. I also participated in the Application Lifecycle Management solution design
                    for many client
                    companies, helping to implement different methodologies into the tools like
                    Agile/Scrum and others.
